# IT254-Project
This Arduino project controls an 8x8 LED matrix using the LedControl library. It displays a smiley face, then switches to a check mark or "X" pattern based on button presses. After a short delay, it resets to the smiley face. The MAX7219 driver manages the LEDs, with debounce handling for button input.
